# NIM Agent Blueprint for Generative Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery

The NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints for generative virtual screening shows how generative AI and accelerated NIM microservices can be used to design optimized small molecules smarter and faster.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showing a complete example. 

Check out the [notebook](./generative-virtual-screening.ipynb) itself for more explanation of how the generative virtual screening pipeline works.
